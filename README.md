# Automatic-Feedback-Analyser


# Introduction

_AFA has been developed with an intent of eliminating an inherent flaw in the feedback generation and usage system currently in place. An inherent flaw in feedback generation exists in the disparity in its importance between the consumer and the organization. While, organic and genuine feedback is a huge asset to the growth of the company, filling out feedback forms every now and then is an unnecessary and cumbersome process for the customers. What we are gunning for is an automated system which replaces this dysfunctional system by an automated feedback and recommendation generation system._
