# Automatic-Feedback-Analyser


# Introduction

_Our product i.e. AFA has been developed with an intent of eliminating an inherent flaw in the feedback generation and usage system currently in place. An inherent flaw in feedback generation exists in the disparity in its importance between the consumer and the organization. While, organic and genuine feedback is a huge asset to the growth of the company, filling out feedback forms every now and then is an unnecessary and cumbersome process for the customers. What we are gunning for is an automated system which replaces this dysfunctional system by an automated feedback and recommendation generation system._

_While, filing out separate feedback forms is tedious and only a few do it, customer care calls happen in magnitude of thousands or greater every single day and are recorded for future analysis. That&#39;s where we come in. We&#39;ll analyse these customer care calls in real time providing the executive with a real time emotional and sentimental analysis of the ongoing call represented graphically and further generating keywords out of it leading to accurate recommendations. Not only this would lift the quality of the currently ongoing call and improve consumer relations.
